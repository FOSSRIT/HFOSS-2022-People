## About

The **People** project [FOSS@MAGIC](https://fossrit.github.io "Free and Open Source Software at RIT") faculty and staff maintain a current roster of:

* Alums
* Faculty
* Mentors
* Students

The profiles are used for record-keeping and contact information.


## Installation

**People** uses a Ruby-based static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).
1. Install `bundler` and this project's `Gemfile`.

    ```bash
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    ```

1. Build the site and make it available on a local server.

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
    ```

1. Browse to http://localhost:4000/people/

Ta-da, the project should appear locally in your browser.
